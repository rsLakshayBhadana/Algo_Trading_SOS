# Algo_Trading_SOS



Developing an algo-trading model with the SMA crossover strategy involves gathering historical price data, calculating short-term and long-term SMAs, and generating buy/sell signals based on their crossovers. Backtesting the strategy on historical data helps assess its performance, and implementing risk management measures is vital for preserving capital. Once thoroughly tested, the model can be deployed for live trading, with continuous monitoring and periodic performance reviews to ensure its effectiveness. The SMA crossover strategy offers a straightforward yet widely used approach for systematic participation in financial markets. However, traders must remain vigilant, adapting the strategy to changing market conditions and avoiding overfitting to past data to achieve long-term success.
